FrostGuardians is a smart fridge food waste management system designed to reduce food waste and carbon emissions. This repository contains the main image analysis AI that detects items in the fridge and predicts the remaining expiration days for each item. It also triggers the backend to initiate user notifications and alerts.

## Getting Started

To get started with FrostGuardians, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main script `app_detect_gpt.py` on your server.
4. For testing purposes, you can use the `testing_app.py` script.

## Usage

Once the system is up and running, it will continuously analyze the images from the fridge and provide predictions for the remaining expiration days of each item. These predictions will be used to send notifications and alerts to the users.
